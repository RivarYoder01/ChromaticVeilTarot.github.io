      <h1>Chromatic Veil Tarot</h1>
	  
	   <h2>Abstract:</h2>
   
   <p>Tarot cards are a deck of seventy-eight cards traditionally used for fortune-telling, 
   reflection, and playing games. A Tarot deck is divided into two card types. The Major Arcana
   contains twenty-two named or picture cards which represent symbolic themes like Death or Justice. 
   The remaining fifty-six cards are the Minor Arcana, containing four suits (Wands, Cups, Pentacles,
   and Swords) of fourteen cards each.</p>
   
   <p>With debated origin, Tarot started as an Italian card game in the fifteenth century before being
   used as an occult indoctrination tool around the French Revolution. From there various iterations 
   evolved, before arriving at the most famous interpretation of Tarot. In 1909, Arthur Edward Waite 
   commissioned Pamela Colman Smith to illustrate his ideals into the cards and published them through
   the company William Rider & Son. More commonly known as the Rider-Waite deck, Smith’s designs have 
   grown to be the standard most modern Tarot decks go by.</p>
   
   <p>This project aims to interpret these ideas through a modern lens and explore the production process
   of a Tarot deck. With seventy-nine total illustrations, the Chromatic Veil Tarot deck features twenty-one 
   cards of the Major Arcana inspired by scratch art and stylized forms. Each suite of the Minor Arcana 
   consists of fourteen illustrations which, once put together, form separate panoramic images, each focused 
   on one of the four elements. All of the cards have a backing design. Rivar used the drawing program Krita 
   to illustrate the deck using a variety of clipping techniques. Her project development thrived on the 
   feedback of peers, and she utilized multiple printing trials both on and off campus.</p>
